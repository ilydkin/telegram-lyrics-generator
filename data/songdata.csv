Voices of Victory
All shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Rays of the will our prophecy filled
I'm the lord of the day and the night
I've nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They pray I will never appear
Their Life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
All the days of his life
He walked without fear
All whose lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So too his justice and retribution were unfailing
As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in the saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
King of kings!!!
King of kings!!!
King Of Kings!

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
The light within
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom Come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall
Kingdom Come
"
Manowar," 
Dreadful Thunder
The storms moving in
And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory 
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
"
Manowar," 
I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die"
Manowar," 
Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived"
Manowar," 
Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...
I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...
"
Manowar," 
He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let ye not pass
Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

Manowar," 
- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a god-damn
bad machine, young'n'hungry, not too proud'n'mean
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Riding, riding, riding, ain't never growin' old.
Take what I want and I go where I please
Got the world right by the balls. This world ain't
big enough to keep me down. Yea we're livin'
in a sick world. The man on the T.V. said we
got lotsa trouble overseas, well what the hell
do I care? Think they care about me?
Stop sending money send'em all a bomb.
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.
Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat.
Well they all want to know what people say is true,
You know, get a biker started 'n he'll drive all
damn night. Well hold on honey 'cause this ride's for a ride.
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
I'm the WARLORD of the road.
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.

I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
HATRED

The war had been raging and ravaging for four years
Leaving millions of casualties from all sides
In the trenches of the frontlines, people have asked the question
What is the price of peace?
How...Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away
Holy...Benedictus
Et Affectus
Benedictus
Halleluja

Warfare, pain and murder
in Golgatha we stand
for the last rite of heaven
the seventh sacrament

Born of blood and fire
and blessed by midnight's hand
in...""O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away...He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He'd found a place
In his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand

Yeah! I've..."
Manowar," 
I don't know
Well, there's no charge for the haircut
And the bullets come free
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:
He's got a mission for me
Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock
"
Manowar,"
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

He is descended from giants. His father Loki
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!
"
Manowar," 
Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I ponder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smashed
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end...
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame!
Blood is our name..
Soul full of thunder!!
Hearts of steel
Killers of men!
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods
today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of Odin we four..!!
By the hammer of Thor!
Ride down from the sky....
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die!!!!
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail
Gods
of War!!!
...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!
"
Manowar," 
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

I arrive a stranger in this land and
Those who seek me their Blood will wash the land
They who need me now reach out their hand
And If she heals me will I be God or Man
Tell Me
Will I live or Die
Then tell me Why
Tell me who I am
God or Man
Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die
My protection I give to those in need
Mother, Son and Daughter and Father will be free
from the chains of death upon them
I shall end their misery
With Blood upon my Hammer
Now the wolves of men shall bleed
Tell Me

Here they lie, gone not forgotten
All the clans from days long ago
In this ground, they rest altogether
Why they fought and died
Shall all come to know
Born with a right
To carry the sword of our fathers
Who fell with their brothers
And ours there below
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands
He said
Carry the fight on for me
For all the sons of the highlands
Fight for the right to be free
Never be owned
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands

Battle hymns did sound the call.
You came to our side.

We give you our blood, we want you to know.
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.
We have read your letters, we have heard your call.
We were brought together 'cause we've got the balls
To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.
You'll live forever, we were born from your belief.
Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song
We want you to know

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, yeah!
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling

Yes I am
I'm gonna ride on you baby! Oh!
"
Manowar," 
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
"
Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
"
Manowar," 
From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
If you want to win tonight, say ""I believe""

I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die
Our blood on the ground

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
"
Manowar," 
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
"
Manowar," 
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano
Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'
Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori
A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra
Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
"
Manowar," 
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
"
Manowar," 
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,

"
Manowar," 
Near to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods, today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail, Gods of War!
Sons of Odin, we four
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die
(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) A warrior's friend
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
(oh) Sons of the gods, today we shall die
(oh) Open Valhalla's door
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail Gods of War!
(oh) Sons of the gods today we shall die
(oh) Open Valhalla's door
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail, Gods of War!
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail
(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!
Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage!
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power!
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day!
Hail Gods Of War!

Manowar," 
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait now we are home
Now we will fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of Steel now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel

"
Manowar," 
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave

Manowar," 
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world"
Manowar," 
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine

Manowar," 
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air,
the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar,
from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection,
success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!
"
Manowar," 
In the nights 
We take flights 
Witness the sites 
The power and glory of steel 
I fought and died 
Lived many lives before 
I am immortal like my sword 
I kneel to no one except the lord 
And my lord is steel 
If you see me you just passed your time 
To the hills you can run but not hide 
Blood and death are wherever i ride 
Armed for battle the lord on my side 
Stand and face the lord of steel 
The lord of steel 
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned 
Let your punishment begin 
Only by death you atone 
You shall not die alone 
For the glory of battle 
I will fight until i die 
Live one day as an eagle 
Or a lifetime as a fly 
Like a candle burning 
The wheels of time are turning 
The lord of steel commands you 
To die by my hand 
Stand and fight the lord of steel 
Time to face the lord of steel
"
Manowar," 
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin!

Manowar," 
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

Manowar," 
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die"
Manowar," 
We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

"
Manowar," 
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
"
Manowar," 
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
"
Manowar," 
If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast
Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder

Manowar," 
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who I am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die
"
Manowar," 
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power

Manowar," 
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
"
Manowar," 
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Manowar," 
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have, one day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Here I'll pass the night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore
Loneliness will fade away
Time will stop until the day
You return into my arms
To hold me like before
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have
One day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe, now and forever
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of...Again, I see you standing there watching me
You gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself, there's fascination in the air

I try to fight this strong...There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit...Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And...Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come the army of the night
Mater Maria
Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final..."
Manowar," 
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my soul.
He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in blood to pay.
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way.
And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up to hells hot wind.
Face one more evil than thou, take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Manowar," 
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there

In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know
On hell's wind, I shall appear, your death will not be slow
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
My vengeance is righteous, my souls fed by hate
My brothers of metal, will you ride with us today?
We ride for death, for glory, for blood and revenge
Lord of steel let the battle begin, and let it never end
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
Death is on my side
Time to seal your fate
Meet the sword of hate
By blood and steel you will die
Death is on my side

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song"
Manowar," 
When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching ""Billy Graham"" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker

And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory 
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die"

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived"

Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...

And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...

He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let ye not pass
Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.

With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.

I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.

With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase

But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock
"
Manowar,"
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Comin' at us no stopping
Always Carry On
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together

Manowar," 
He is descended from giants. His father Loki
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam

You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, hey

Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
Now, you were sittin' home

""Powers of the Universe did sire a Son
He was baptized by Fire Water Earth and Sky
From darkness he rose up in Triumph
To ascend the Throne of Light
And He Alone shall forever be known
As the King of Kings""
I entered this World born under a sign of Infinite Light
And here I shall dwell
I now understand all that I am
Shall live in Thy command!
"
Manowar," 
In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

Manowar," 
Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I ponder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smashed
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end...
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame!
Blood is our name..
Soul full of thunder!!
Hearts of steel
Killers of men!
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods
today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of Odin we four..!!
By the hammer of Thor!
Ride down from the sky....
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die!!!!
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail
Gods
of War!!!
...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!
"
Manowar," 
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

Born with a right
To carry the sword of our fathers
Who fell with their brothers
And ours there below
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands
He said
Carry the fight on for me
For all the sons of the highlands
Fight for the right to be free
Never be owned
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands

In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.

To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.

So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh!

From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave

I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

Raise thy hand

Await thy command

Bring an end to their story
Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
"
Manowar," 
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!
"
Manowar," 
Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
"
Manowar," 
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
"
Manowar," 
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

Manowar," 
In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano
Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'
Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori
A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra
Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quello che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Padre, un' ultima cosa
Tu hai sempre saputo
Che quello che hai detto
Era vero
"
Manowar," 
Warriors take the field
The battlefield of life
You cannot run
You cannot hide
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Only one of us will win
and return to fight again
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide
I've sworn an oath in blood to defend the land
and all who wish to test their steel well here I am
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide

Manowar," 
Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
"
Manowar," 
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
"
Manowar," 
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,
The  black,and the wicked are

"
Manowar," 
Near to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods, today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail, Gods of War!
Sons of Odin, we four
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die
(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) A warrior's friend
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

(oh) Hail, Gods of War!
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail
(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!
Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage!
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power!
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day!
Hail Gods Of War!
"
Manowar," 
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait now we are home
Now we will fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of Steel now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel

"
Manowar," 
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave

Manowar," 
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world"
Manowar," 
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine

Manowar," 
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air,
the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar,
from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection,
success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!
"
Manowar," 
In the nights 
We take flights 
Witness the sites 
The power and glory of steel 
I fought and died 
Lived many lives before 
I am immortal like my sword 
I kneel to no one except the lord 
And my lord is steel 
If you see me you just passed your time 
To the hills you can run but not hide 
Blood and death are wherever i ride 
Armed for battle the lord on my side 
Stand and face the lord of steel 
The lord of steel 
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned 
Let your punishment begin 
Only by death you atone 
You shall not die alone 
For the glory of battle 
I will fight until i die 
Live one day as an eagle 
Or a lifetime as a fly 
Like a candle burning 
The wheels of time are turning 
The lord of steel commands you 
To die by my hand 
Stand and fight the lord of steel 
Time to face the lord of steel
"
Manowar," 
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin!

Manowar," 
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

Manowar," 
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die"
Manowar," 
We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more

Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

"
Manowar," 
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
"
Manowar," 
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
"
Manowar," 
If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast
Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder
"
Manowar," 
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
"
Manowar," 
Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who I am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die

Manowar," 
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
"
Manowar," 
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
"
Manowar," 
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have, one day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Here I'll pass the night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore
Loneliness will fade away
Time will stop until the day
You return into my arms
To hold me like before
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have
One day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe, now and forever
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of...Again, I see you standing there watching me
You gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself, there's fascination in the air

I try to fight this strong...There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit...Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And...Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come the army of the night
Mater Maria
Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final..."
Manowar," 
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my soul.
He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in blood to pay.
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way.
And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up to hells hot wind.
Face one more evil than thou, take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Manowar," 
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Manowar," 
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know
On hell's wind, I shall appear, your death will not be slow
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
My vengeance is righteous, my souls fed by hate
My brothers of metal, will you ride with us today?
We ride for death, for glory, for blood and revenge
Lord of steel let the battle begin, and let it never end
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song"
Manowar," 
When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching ""Billy Graham"" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away

My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They pray I will never appear
Their Life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
All the days of his life
He walked without fear
All whose lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So too his justice and retribution were unfailing
As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in the saddle

Dreadful Thunder
The storms moving in
And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory 
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die"
Manowar," 
Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived"
Manowar," 
Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...
I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...
"
Manowar," 
He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let ye not pass
Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives
"
Manowar," 
Voices of Victory
All Shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Raise of the will our  prophecy filled
I'm the lord of the day and the night
Ive nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They Pray I will never appear
The Life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
All the days of his live
He walked without fear
All who's lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So true is justice and retribution were un failling
As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings..
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
King of kings!!!
King of kings!!!
King of...
Of Kings!

- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin

I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.

The war had been raging and ravaging for four years
Leaving millions of casualties from all sides
In the trenches of the frontlines, people have asked the question
What is the price of peace?
How...Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away
Holy...Benedictus
Et Affectus
Benedictus
Halleluja

Warfare, pain and murder
in Golgatha we stand
for the last rite of heaven
the seventh sacrament

Born of blood and fire
and blessed by midnight's hand
in...""O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away...He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He'd found a place
In his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand

Yeah! I've..."

I don't know
Well, there's no charge for the haircut
And the bullets come free
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:
He's got a mission for me
Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa

Manowar,"
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

He is descended from giants. His father Loki
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land

Ride down from the sky....

...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!

Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name

I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.

To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.

Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song
We want you to know

Louder than hell
Warriors of the world

Stand our ground knights immortal
For metal once more
Hail kill and die

And grind to dust
Those who deny
Our sacred right
Of glory and might
We shall survive
Hail kill and die
Hail kill and die
Dark avengers armed with hatred
Black arrows and wings

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, yeah!
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling

Yes I am
I'm gonna ride on you baby! Oh!
"
Manowar," 
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
"
Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh!

Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!

Manowar," 
From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
If you want to win tonight, say ""I believe""

I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

Hearts full of rage

Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Father on bended knee

Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
"
Manowar," 
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
"
Manowar," 
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano
Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'
Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori
A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra
Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quello che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Padre, un' ultima cosa
Tu hai sempre saputo
Che quello che hai detto
Era vero

Only one of us will win
and return to fight again

Decided by the Gods
Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide
I've sworn an oath in blood to defend the land
and all who wish to test their steel well here I am

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
"
Manowar," 
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
"
Manowar," 
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,

"
Manowar," 
Near to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods, today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail, Gods of War!
Sons of Odin, we four
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die
(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) A warrior's friend
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!
Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage!
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power!
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day!
Hail Gods Of War!

Manowar," 
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might

Manowar," 
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave

Manowar," 
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world"
Manowar," 
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine

They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air,
the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar,
from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection,
success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!

Manowar," 
In the nights 
We take flights 
Witness the sites 
The power and glory of steel 
I fought and died 
Lived many lives before 
I am immortal like my sword 
I kneel to no one except the lord 
And my lord is steel 
If you see me you just passed your time 
To the hills you can run but not hide 
Blood and death are wherever i ride 
Armed for battle the lord on my side 
Stand and face the lord of steel 
The lord of steel 
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned 
Let your punishment begin 
Only by death you atone 
You shall not die alone 
For the glory of battle 
I will fight until i die 
Live one day as an eagle 
Or a lifetime as a fly 
Like a candle burning 
The wheels of time are turning 
The lord of steel commands you 
To die by my hand 
Stand and fight the lord of steel 
Time to face the lord of steel
"
Manowar," 
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin!
"
Manowar," 
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

Manowar," 
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die"
Manowar," 
We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

Manowar," 
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
"
Manowar," 
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
"
Manowar," 
If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast
Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder
"
Manowar," 
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who I am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die
"
Manowar," 
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
"
Manowar," 
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
"
Manowar," 
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have, one day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Here I'll pass the night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore
Loneliness will fade away
Time will stop until the day
You return into my arms
To hold me like before
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have
One day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe, now and forever
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of...Again, I see you standing there watching me
You gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself, there's fascination in the air

I try to fight this strong...There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit...Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And...Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come the army of the night
Mater Maria
Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final..."
Manowar," 
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my soul.
He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in blood to pay.
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way.
And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up to hells hot wind.
Face one more evil than thou, take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die

Covered with blood and our pride

Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Manowar," 
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know
On hell's wind, I shall appear, your death will not be slow
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
My vengeance is righteous, my souls fed by hate
My brothers of metal, will you ride with us today?
We ride for death, for glory, for blood and revenge

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song"

When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw

Shot of whisky I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching ""Billy Graham"" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away

Dreadful Thunder
The storms moving in
And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory 
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die"
Manowar," 
Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived"
Manowar," 
Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...
I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...

Manowar," 
He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let ye not pass
Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

Manowar," 
- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a god-damn
bad machine, young'n'hungry, not too proud'n'mean

Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat.
Well they all want to know what people say is true,
You know, get a biker started 'n he'll drive all
damn night. Well hold on honey 'cause this ride's for a ride.

I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign

I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase

The war had been raging and ravaging for four years
Leaving millions of casualties from all sides
In the trenches of the frontlines, people have asked the question
What is the price of peace?
How...Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away

Born of blood and fire
and blessed by midnight's hand

Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away...He had enough

They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand

I don't know
Well, there's no charge for the haircut
And the bullets come free
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:

Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone

Manowar,"
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

He is descended from giants. His father Loki
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
"
Manowar," 
If I Should Return
With My Body On My Shield
Tell My Son I Chose To Die Than Yield
Though My Life May Soon Be Gone
I Hope You'll Carry On
Remember Me As One Who Would Not Kneel
Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride
Into Glory We Shall Ride
I Am Driven On In The Face Of All Despair
Trust In Steel You Will Find Me There
A Sinner's Fate Awaits Me
But My Vision Guides Me On
I Will Not Stray
From The Path I'm Set Upon
I'll Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride
Into Glory We Shall Ride
If I Do Not Return
Bring My Body On My Shield
Tell My Son I Chose To Die
I Chose To Die Than Yield
Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield

Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride

Into Glory We Shall Ride
I'll Die Fighting With My Brothers Side By Side

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, hey
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side

Hey

""Powers of the Universe did sire a Son
He was baptized by Fire Water Earth and Sky
From darkness he rose up in Triumph
To ascend the Throne of Light
And He Alone shall forever be known
As the King of Kings""
I entered this World born under a sign of Infinite Light
And here I shall dwell
I now understand all that I am
Shall live in Thy command!
"
Manowar," 
In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!
"
Manowar," 
Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I ponder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smashed
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end...
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame!
Blood is our name..
Soul full of thunder!!
Hearts of steel
Killers of men!
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods
today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of Odin we four..!!
By the hammer of Thor!
Ride down from the sky....
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die!!!!
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail
Gods
of War!!!
...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!
"
Manowar," 
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

Here they lie, gone not forgotten
All the clans from days long ago
In this ground, they rest altogether
Why they fought and died
Shall all come to know
Born with a right
To carry the sword of our fathers
Who fell with their brothers
And ours there below
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands
He said
Carry the fight on for me
For all the sons of the highlands
Fight for the right to be free
Never be owned
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands

Battle hymns did sound the call.
You came to our side.
You heard true metal
Into glory ride.

You wait in the rain, you walk through the snow.
We give you our blood, we want you to know.
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.
We have read your letters, we have heard your call.
We were brought together 'cause we've got the balls
To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.
You'll live forever, we were born from your belief.
Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song
We want you to know
In our eyes you're immortal

"
Manowar," 
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
"
Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!

Manowar," 
From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
If you want to win tonight, say ""I believe""

I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
"
Manowar," 
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
"
Manowar," 
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano
Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'
Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori
A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra
Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere
Sei con me

"
Manowar," 
Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
"
Manowar," 
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
"
Manowar," 
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,
The  black,and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
"
Manowar," 
Near to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods, today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail, Gods of War!
Sons of Odin, we four
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die
(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) A warrior's friend
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
(oh) Sons of the gods, today we shall die
(oh) Open Valhalla's door
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail Gods of War!
(oh) Sons of the gods today we shall die
(oh) Open Valhalla's door
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail, Gods of War!
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail
(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!
Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage!
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power!
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day!
Hail Gods Of War!
"
Manowar," 
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait now we are home
Now we will fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of Steel now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel
Fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win

Defenders of Steel now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
"
Manowar," 
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave
"
Manowar," 
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait, now we are home
Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel"
Manowar," 
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world"
Manowar," 
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine
"
Manowar," 
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air,
the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar,
from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection,
success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!
"
Manowar," 
In the nights 
We take flights 
Witness the sites 
The power and glory of steel 
I fought and died 
Lived many lives before 
I am immortal like my sword 
I kneel to no one except the lord 
And my lord is steel 
If you see me you just passed your time 
To the hills you can run but not hide 
Blood and death are wherever i ride 
Armed for battle the lord on my side 
Stand and face the lord of steel 
The lord of steel 
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned 
Let your punishment begin 
Only by death you atone 
You shall not die alone 
For the glory of battle 
I will fight until i die 
Live one day as an eagle 
Or a lifetime as a fly 
Like a candle burning 
The wheels of time are turning 
The lord of steel commands you 
To die by my hand 
Stand and fight the lord of steel 
Time to face the lord of steel
"
Manowar," 
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin!
"
Manowar," 
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
"
Manowar," 
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die"
Manowar," 
We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
"
Manowar," 
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
"
Manowar," 
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
"
Manowar," 
If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast
Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder
"
Manowar," 
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
"
Manowar," 
Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who I am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die
"
Manowar," 
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
"
Manowar," 
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
"
Manowar," 
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Manowar," 
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have, one day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Here I'll pass the night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore
Loneliness will fade away
Time will stop until the day
You return into my arms
To hold me like before
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have
One day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe, now and forever
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of...Again, I see you standing there watching me
You gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself, there's fascination in the air

I try to fight this strong...There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit...Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And...Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come the army of the night
Mater Maria
Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final..."
Manowar," 
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my soul.
He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in blood to pay.
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way.
And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up to hells hot wind.
Face one more evil than thou, take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Manowar," 
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know
On hell's wind, I shall appear, your death will not be slow
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know

By blood and steel you will die
My vengeance is righteous, my souls fed by hate
My brothers of metal, will you ride with us today?
We ride for death, for glory, for blood and revenge

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song"

When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching ""Billy Graham"" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker

So too his justice and retribution were unfailing
As my sword is my soul

And Judgment day is calling

By the power of steel
And the sound of glory

All that are found

Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die"

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived"

Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known

And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...

He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let ye not pass
Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.

"
Manowar," 
I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
HATRED

The war had been raging and ravaging for four years
Leaving millions of casualties from all sides
In the trenches of the frontlines, people have asked the question
What is the price of peace?
How...Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away
Holy...Benedictus
Et Affectus
Benedictus
Halleluja

Warfare, pain and murder
in Golgatha we stand
for the last rite of heaven
the seventh sacrament

Born of blood and fire
and blessed by midnight's hand
in...""O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away...He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He'd found a place
In his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand

Yeah! I've..."
Manowar," 
I don't know
Well, there's no charge for the haircut
And the bullets come free
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:
He's got a mission for me
Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock
"
Manowar,"
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

Manowar," 
We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest
The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1
Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Comin' at us no stopping
Always Carry On
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together

Manowar," 
He is descended from giants. His father Loki
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, hey
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job

""Powers of the Universe did sire a Son
He was baptized by Fire Water Earth and Sky
From darkness he rose up in Triumph
To ascend the Throne of Light
And He Alone shall forever be known
As the King of Kings""
I entered this World born under a sign of Infinite Light
And here I shall dwell
I now understand all that I am
Shall live in Thy command!
"
Manowar," 
In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!
"
Manowar," 
Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I ponder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smashed
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end...
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame!
Blood is our name..
Soul full of thunder!!
Hearts of steel
Killers of men!
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods
today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of Odin we four..!!
By the hammer of Thor!
Ride down from the sky....
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die!!!!
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail
Gods
of War!!!
...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!
"
Manowar," 
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands
He said
Carry the fight on for me
For all the sons of the highlands
Fight for the right to be free

So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high

Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!

From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
If you want to win tonight, say ""I believe""

I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war
Odin here the fallen wait
To join thee by thy side
Let Valhalla's gates open wide
Born under the sign
Of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

Manowar," 
Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
"
Manowar," 
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano
Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'
Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori
A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra
Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere
Sei con me

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
"
Manowar," 
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
"
Manowar," 
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,

"
Manowar," 
Near to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods, today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail, Gods of War!
Sons of Odin, we four
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die
(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) A warrior's friend
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

(oh) Hail
(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!
Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage!
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power!
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day!
Hail Gods Of War!

So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might

Manowar," 
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave

Manowar," 
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world"

She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine

Manowar," 
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air,
the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar,
from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection,
success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!
"
Manowar," 
In the nights 
We take flights 
Witness the sites 
The power and glory of steel 
I fought and died 
Lived many lives before 
I am immortal like my sword 
I kneel to no one except the lord 
And my lord is steel 
If you see me you just passed your time 
To the hills you can run but not hide 
Blood and death are wherever i ride 
Armed for battle the lord on my side 
Stand and face the lord of steel 
The lord of steel 
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned 
Let your punishment begin 
Only by death you atone 
You shall not die alone 
For the glory of battle 
I will fight until i die 
Live one day as an eagle 
Or a lifetime as a fly 
Like a candle burning 
The wheels of time are turning 
The lord of steel commands you 
To die by my hand 
Stand and fight the lord of steel 
Time to face the lord of steel
"
Manowar," 
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end

Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die

Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die"

We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

Born to live forever more

Manowar," 
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!

We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
"
Manowar," 
If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast
Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder
"
Manowar," 
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who I am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die
"
Manowar," 
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
"
Manowar," 
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
"
Manowar," 
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have, one day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Here I'll pass the night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore
Loneliness will fade away
Time will stop until the day
You return into my arms
To hold me like before
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have
One day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe, now and forever
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of...Again, I see you standing there watching me
You gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself, there's fascination in the air

I try to fight this strong...There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit...Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And...Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come the army of the night
Mater Maria
Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final..."
Manowar," 
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my soul.
He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in blood to pay.
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way.
And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up to hells hot wind.
Face one more evil than thou, take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Manowar," 
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
"
Manowar," 
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know
On hell's wind, I shall appear, your death will not be slow
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
My vengeance is righteous, my souls fed by hate
My brothers of metal, will you ride with us today?
We ride for death, for glory, for blood and revenge
Lord of steel let the battle begin, and let it never end
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song"

When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching ""Billy Graham"" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away

All shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Rays of the will our prophecy filled

I've nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They pray I will never appear
Their Life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
All the days of his life
He walked without fear
All whose lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So too his justice and retribution were unfailing
As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in the saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all

Dreadful Thunder
The storms moving in
And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory 
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
"
Manowar," 
I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die"
Manowar," 
Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived"
Manowar," 
Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...
I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...
"
Manowar," 
He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let ye not pass
Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives
"
Manowar," 
Voices of Victory
All Shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Raise of the will our  prophecy filled
I'm the lord of the day and the night
Ive nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They Pray I will never appear
The Life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
All the days of his live
He walked without fear
All who's lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So true is justice and retribution were un failling
As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings..
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
King of kings!!!
King of kings!!!
King of...
Of Kings!

Manowar," 
- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down

I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.

The war had been raging and ravaging for four years
Leaving millions of casualties from all sides
In the trenches of the frontlines, people have asked the question
What is the price of peace?
How...Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away
Holy...Benedictus
Et Affectus
Benedictus
Halleluja

Warfare, pain and murder
in Golgatha we stand
for the last rite of heaven
the seventh sacrament

Born of blood and fire
and blessed by midnight's hand
in...""O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away...He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He'd found a place
In his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand

Yeah! I've..."
Manowar," 
I don't know
Well, there's no charge for the haircut
And the bullets come free
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:
He's got a mission for me
Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa
Shell shock
Shell shock

Manowar,"
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

He is descended from giants. His father Loki
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!

I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

"
Manowar," 
I arrive a stranger in this land and
Those who seek me their Blood will wash the land
They who need me now reach out their hand
And If she heals me will I be God or Man
Tell Me
Will I live or Die
Then tell me Why
Tell me who I am
God or Man
Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die
My protection I give to those in need
Mother, Son and Daughter and Father will be free
from the chains of death upon them
I shall end their misery
With Blood upon my Hammer
Now the wolves of men shall bleed
Tell Me
Will I live or Die
Then tell me Why
Now tell me who I am
God or Man
Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die
I'm Alive
And I know Why
Cause of Lies
For you will die
You'll know the curse of my pain
Thunder and Rain
My protection I give to those in need
Mother, Son and Daughter and Father will be free
From the chains of death upon them
I shall end their misery
With Blood upon my Hammer
Now the wolves of men shall bleed
Step Aside
Where I ride
Step Aside
Or you will die
I'm Alive
And I know Why
Cause of Lies
You will die
"
Manowar," 
Here they lie, gone not forgotten
All the clans from days long ago
In this ground, they rest altogether
Why they fought and died
Shall all come to know
Born with a right
To carry the sword of our fathers
Who fell with their brothers
And ours there below
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands
He said
Carry the fight on for me
For all the sons of the highlands
Fight for the right to be free
Never be owned
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands
"
Manowar," 
Battle hymns did sound the call.
You came to our side.
You heard true metal
Into glory ride.
Come on yea
You stood beside us,
The false ones cries.
Your love is judgment,
You gave us life.
You wait in the rain, you walk through the snow.
We give you our blood, we want you to know.
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.
We have read your letters, we have heard your call.
We were brought together 'cause we've got the balls
To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.
You'll live forever, we were born from your belief.
Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song
We want you to know
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more
Metal makes us strong

On hymns of battle we rode to glory

Stand our ground knights immortal
For metal once more
Hail kill and die

And grind to dust
Those who deny

Of glory and might
We shall survive
Hail kill and die
Hail kill and die
Dark avengers armed with hatred
Black arrows and wings

We all touch the sky
Hail kill and die

"
Manowar," 
Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, yeah!
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
Death tone
Death tone
Gonna ride on my death tone
Yes I am
I'm gonna ride on you baby! Oh!
"
Manowar," 
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
"
Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
"
Manowar," 
From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
If you want to win tonight, say ""I believe""
"
Manowar," 
I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

Manowar," 
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war
Odin here the fallen wait
To join thee by thy side
Let Valhalla's gates open wide
Born under the sign
Of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate

"
Manowar," 
Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
"
Manowar," 
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
"
Manowar," 
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano
Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'
Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori
A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra
Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quello che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Padre, un' ultima cosa
Tu hai sempre saputo
Che quello che hai detto
Era vero

Warriors take the field
The battlefield of life
You cannot run
You cannot hide
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Only one of us will win
and return to fight again
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide
I've sworn an oath in blood to defend the land
and all who wish to test their steel well here I am
I am the keeper of the laws

from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me

Manowar," 
Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
"
Manowar," 
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
"
Manowar," 
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,

"
Manowar," 
Near to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods, today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail, Gods of War!
Sons of Odin, we four
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die
(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) A warrior's friend

(oh) Hail
(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!
Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage!
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power!
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day!
Hail Gods Of War!
"
Manowar," 
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait now we are home
Now we will fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die

Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave
"
Manowar," 
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait, now we are home
Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel"
Manowar," 
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world"
Manowar," 
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine

Manowar," 
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air,
the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar,
from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection,
success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!
"
Manowar," 
In the nights 
We take flights 
Witness the sites 
The power and glory of steel 
I fought and died 
Lived many lives before 
I am immortal like my sword 
I kneel to no one except the lord 
And my lord is steel 
If you see me you just passed your time 
To the hills you can run but not hide 
Blood and death are wherever i ride 
Armed for battle the lord on my side 
Stand and face the lord of steel 
The lord of steel 
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned 
Let your punishment begin 
Only by death you atone 
You shall not die alone 
For the glory of battle 
I will fight until i die 
Live one day as an eagle 
Or a lifetime as a fly 
Like a candle burning 
The wheels of time are turning 
The lord of steel commands you 
To die by my hand 
Stand and fight the lord of steel 
Time to face the lord of steel
"
Manowar," 
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin!

Manowar," 
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
"
Manowar," 
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die"
Manowar," 
We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

Manowar," 
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
"
Manowar," 
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
"
Manowar," 
If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast
Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder
"
Manowar," 
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who I am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die
"
Manowar," 
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
"
Manowar," 
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
"
Manowar," 
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Manowar," 
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have, one day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Here I'll pass the night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore
Loneliness will fade away
Time will stop until the day
You return into my arms
To hold me like before
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have
One day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe, now and forever
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of...Again, I see you standing there watching me
You gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself, there's fascination in the air

I try to fight this strong...There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit...Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And...Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come the army of the night
Mater Maria
Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final..."
Manowar," 
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my soul.
He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in blood to pay.
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way.
And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up to hells hot wind.
Face one more evil than thou, take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride

Covered with blood and our pride

Manowar," 
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Manowar," 
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know
On hell's wind, I shall appear, your death will not be slow
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
My vengeance is righteous, my souls fed by hate
My brothers of metal, will you ride with us today?
We ride for death, for glory, for blood and revenge
Lord of steel let the battle begin, and let it never end
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
Death is on my side
Time to seal your fate
Meet the sword of hate
By blood and steel you will die

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song"
Manowar," 
When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching ""Billy Graham"" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away

So too his justice and retribution were unfailing
As my sword is my soul

And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory 
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die"
Manowar," 
Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived"
Manowar," 
Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...
I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...

He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let ye not pass
Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

Manowar," 
- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a god-damn
bad machine, young'n'hungry, not too proud'n'mean

With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase

The war had been raging and ravaging for four years
Leaving millions of casualties from all sides

And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa

I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest
The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1
Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame
The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1
Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Comin' at us no stopping
Always Carry On
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Manowar," 
He is descended from giants. His father Loki
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
"
Manowar,"

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, hey
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling

Hear me ride

""Powers of the Universe did sire a Son
He was baptized by Fire Water Earth and Sky
From darkness he rose up in Triumph
To ascend the Throne of Light
And He Alone shall forever be known
As the King of Kings""
I entered this World born under a sign of Infinite Light
And here I shall dwell
I now understand all that I am
Shall live in Thy command!
"
Manowar," 
In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!
"
Manowar," 
Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I ponder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smashed
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end...
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame!
Blood is our name..
Soul full of thunder!!
Hearts of steel
Killers of men!
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods
today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of Odin we four..!!
By the hammer of Thor!
Ride down from the sky....
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die!!!!
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail
Gods
of War!!!
...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!
"
Manowar," 
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

I arrive a stranger in this land and

And If she heals me will I be God or Man
Tell Me

Then tell me Why
Tell me who I am
God or Man
Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die
My protection I give to those in need

Here they lie, gone not forgotten
All the clans from days long ago
In this ground, they rest altogether
Why they fought and died
Shall all come to know
Born with a right
To carry the sword of our fathers
Who fell with their brothers
And ours there below
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands
He said
Carry the fight on for me
For all the sons of the highlands
Fight for the right to be free
Never be owned
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands

Battle hymns did sound the call.
You came to our side.
You heard true metal
Into glory ride.

You wait in the rain, you walk through the snow.
We give you our blood, we want you to know.
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.
We have read your letters, we have heard your call.
We were brought together 'cause we've got the balls
To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.
You'll live forever, we were born from your belief.
Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song
We want you to know

Manowar," 
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!

From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave

I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

Crossing the sky
Lords of doom

Await thy command

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

Manowar," 
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
"
Manowar," 
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

Manowar," 
In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano
Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'
Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori
A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra
Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quello che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Padre, un' ultima cosa
Tu hai sempre saputo
Che quello che hai detto
Era vero
"
Manowar," 
Warriors take the field
The battlefield of life
You cannot run
You cannot hide
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Only one of us will win
and return to fight again
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide
I've sworn an oath in blood to defend the land
and all who wish to test their steel well here I am
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide
"

Manowar," 
Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
"
Manowar," 
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
"
Manowar," 
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,

"
Manowar," 
Near to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods, today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail, Gods of War!
Sons of Odin, we four
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die
(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) A warrior's friend
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
(oh) Sons of the gods, today we shall die
(oh) Open Valhalla's door

(oh) Hail, Gods of War!
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail
(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!
Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage!
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power!
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day!
Hail Gods Of War!
"
Manowar," 
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait now we are home
Now we will fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of Steel now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel

"
Manowar," 
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave

Manowar," 
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world"
Manowar," 
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine

Manowar," 
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air,
the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar,
from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection,
success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!
"
Manowar," 
In the nights 
We take flights 
Witness the sites 
The power and glory of steel 
I fought and died 
Lived many lives before 
I am immortal like my sword 
I kneel to no one except the lord 
And my lord is steel 
If you see me you just passed your time 
To the hills you can run but not hide 
Blood and death are wherever i ride 
Armed for battle the lord on my side 
Stand and face the lord of steel 
The lord of steel 
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned 
Let your punishment begin 
Only by death you atone 
You shall not die alone 
For the glory of battle 
I will fight until i die 
Live one day as an eagle 
Or a lifetime as a fly 
Like a candle burning 
The wheels of time are turning 
The lord of steel commands you 
To die by my hand 
Stand and fight the lord of steel 
Time to face the lord of steel
"
Manowar," 
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin!
"
Manowar," 
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

Manowar," 
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die"
Manowar," 
We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more

Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

Manowar," 
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
"
Manowar," 
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
"
Manowar," 
If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast
Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder

Manowar," 
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who I am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die
"
Manowar," 
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
"
Manowar," 
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
"
Manowar," 
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing

Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have, one day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Here I'll pass the night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore
Loneliness will fade away
Time will stop until the day
You return into my arms
To hold me like before
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have
One day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe, now and forever
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of...Again, I see you standing there watching me
You gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself, there's fascination in the air

I try to fight this strong...There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit...Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And...Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come the army of the night
Mater Maria
Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final..."
Manowar," 
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my soul.
He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in blood to pay.
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way.
And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up to hells hot wind.
Face one more evil than thou, take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Manowar," 
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Manowar," 
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know
On hell's wind, I shall appear, your death will not be slow
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
My vengeance is righteous, my souls fed by hate
My brothers of metal, will you ride with us today?
We ride for death, for glory, for blood and revenge
Lord of steel let the battle begin, and let it never end
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song"
Manowar," 
When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching ""Billy Graham"" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away

And the sound of glory

Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave

Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land

And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle

So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die"

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived"
Manowar," 
Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...
I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...

He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let ye not pass
Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a god-damn
bad machine, young'n'hungry, not too proud'n'mean
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Riding, riding, riding, ain't never growin' old.

Got the world right by the balls. This world ain't
big enough to keep me down. Yea we're livin'
in a sick world. The man on the T.V. said we

Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.
Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat.
Well they all want to know what people say is true,
You know, get a biker started 'n he'll drive all
damn night. Well hold on honey 'cause this ride's for a ride.
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride

I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
HATRED

The war had been raging and ravaging for four years
Leaving millions of casualties from all sides
In the trenches of the frontlines, people have asked the question
What is the price of peace?
How...Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away
Holy...Benedictus
Et Affectus
Benedictus
Halleluja

Warfare, pain and murder
in Golgatha we stand
for the last rite of heaven
the seventh sacrament

Born of blood and fire
and blessed by midnight's hand
in...""O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away...He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He'd found a place
In his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand

Yeah! I've..."
Manowar," 
I don't know
Well, there's no charge for the haircut
And the bullets come free
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:
He's got a mission for me
Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock
"
Manowar,"
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

He is descended from giants. His father Loki
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night

The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smashed
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end...
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame!
Blood is our name..
Soul full of thunder!!
Hearts of steel
Killers of men!
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods

Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of Odin we four..!!
By the hammer of Thor!
Ride down from the sky....
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die!!!!
Glory and fame

Hail
Gods

...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!

Manowar," 
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, yeah!
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
Death tone
Death tone
Gonna ride on my death tone
Yes I am
I'm gonna ride on you baby! Oh!
"
Manowar," 
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
"
Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!

Manowar," 
From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave

I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command

Manowar," 
Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

Manowar," 
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
"
Manowar," 
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano
Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'
Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori
A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra
Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quello che faccio

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
"
Manowar," 
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.

Manowar," 
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,

"
Manowar," 
Near to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods, today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail, Gods of War!
Sons of Odin, we four
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die
(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) A warrior's friend

(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!
Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage!
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power!
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day!
Hail Gods Of War!

Manowar," 
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved

Manowar," 
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world"

She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine

Manowar," 
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air,
the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar,
from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection,
success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!
"
Manowar," 
In the nights 
We take flights 
Witness the sites 
The power and glory of steel 
I fought and died 
Lived many lives before 
I am immortal like my sword 
I kneel to no one except the lord 
And my lord is steel 
If you see me you just passed your time 
To the hills you can run but not hide 
Blood and death are wherever i ride 
Armed for battle the lord on my side 
Stand and face the lord of steel 
The lord of steel 
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned 
Let your punishment begin 
Only by death you atone 
You shall not die alone 
For the glory of battle 
I will fight until i die 
Live one day as an eagle 
Or a lifetime as a fly 
Like a candle burning 
The wheels of time are turning 
The lord of steel commands you 
To die by my hand 
Stand and fight the lord of steel 
Time to face the lord of steel
"
Manowar," 
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin!

Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

Manowar," 
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die"
Manowar," 
We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

Manowar," 
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
"
Manowar," 
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
"
Manowar," 
If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast
Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder
"
Manowar," 
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who I am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right

Vengeance thine
Lord of steel

Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life

"
Manowar," 
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
"
Manowar," 
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
"
Manowar," 
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have, one day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Here I'll pass the night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore
Loneliness will fade away
Time will stop until the day
You return into my arms
To hold me like before
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have
One day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe, now and forever
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of...Again, I see you standing there watching me
You gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself, there's fascination in the air

I try to fight this strong...There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit...Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And...Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come the army of the night
Mater Maria
Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final..."
Manowar," 
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my soul.
He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in blood to pay.
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way.
And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up to hells hot wind.
Face one more evil than thou, take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Manowar," 
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Manowar," 
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know
On hell's wind, I shall appear, your death will not be slow
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
My vengeance is righteous, my souls fed by hate
My brothers of metal, will you ride with us today?
We ride for death, for glory, for blood and revenge
Lord of steel let the battle begin, and let it never end

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song"

When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching ""Billy Graham"" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me

Is one thing never seen
A long time ago
You tried to tell me son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
"
Manowar," 
Voices of Victory
All shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Rays of the will our prophecy filled
I'm the lord of the day and the night
I've nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They pray I will never appear
Their Life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
All the days of his life
He walked without fear
All whose lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So too his justice and retribution were unfailing
As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in the saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
King of kings!!!
King of kings!!!

Manowar," 
Dreadful Thunder
The storms moving in
And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory 
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle

Manowar," 
I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die"
Manowar," 
Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived"
Manowar," 
Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...
I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...
"
Manowar," 
He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let ye not pass
Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

Manowar," 
- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a god-damn

Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.
Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.

Well they all want to know what people say is true,
You know, get a biker started 'n he'll drive all

I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.

The war had been raging and ravaging for four years
Leaving millions of casualties from all sides
In the trenches of the frontlines, people have asked the question
What is the price of peace?
How...Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away
Holy...Benedictus
Et Affectus
Benedictus
Halleluja

Warfare, pain and murder
in Golgatha we stand
for the last rite of heaven
the seventh sacrament

Born of blood and fire
and blessed by midnight's hand
in...""O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away...He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He'd found a place
In his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand

Yeah! I've..."
Manowar," 
I don't know
Well, there's no charge for the haircut
And the bullets come free
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:
He's got a mission for me
Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock

Manowar,"
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

He is descended from giants. His father Loki
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla

Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla

Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!
"
Manowar," 
Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I ponder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smashed
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end...
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame!
Blood is our name..
Soul full of thunder!!
Hearts of steel
Killers of men!
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods
today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of Odin we four..!!
By the hammer of Thor!
Ride down from the sky....
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die!!!!
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail
Gods
of War!!!
...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!
"
Manowar," 
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

I arrive a stranger in this land and
Those who seek me their Blood will wash the land

And If she heals me will I be God or Man
Tell Me
Will I live or Die
Then tell me Why
Tell me who I am
God or Man
Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die
My protection I give to those in need

Here they lie, gone not forgotten
All the clans from days long ago
In this ground, they rest altogether
Why they fought and died
Shall all come to know
Born with a right
To carry the sword of our fathers
Who fell with their brothers
And ours there below
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands
He said
Carry the fight on for me
For all the sons of the highlands
Fight for the right to be free
Never be owned
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands

Battle hymns did sound the call.
You came to our side.

We give you our blood, we want you to know.
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.
We have read your letters, we have heard your call.
We were brought together 'cause we've got the balls
To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.
You'll live forever, we were born from your belief.
Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song
We want you to know

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, yeah!
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling

I'm gonna ride on you baby! Oh!
"
Manowar," 
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
"
Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
"
Manowar," 
From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
If you want to win tonight, say ""I believe""

I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

Manowar," 
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
"
Manowar," 
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano
Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'
Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori
A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra
Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
"
Manowar," 
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.

Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,

Where blood of my enemies lies.
"
Manowar," 
Near to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods, today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail, Gods of War!
Sons of Odin, we four
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die
(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) A warrior's friend
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
(oh) Sons of the gods, today we shall die
(oh) Open Valhalla's door
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail Gods of War!
(oh) Sons of the gods today we shall die
(oh) Open Valhalla's door
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail, Gods of War!
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail
(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!
Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage!
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power!
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day!
Hail Gods Of War!
"
Manowar," 
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait now we are home
Now we will fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of Steel now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel
Fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel

Their blood is upon my steel
"
Manowar," 
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave

Manowar," 
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world"
Manowar," 
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine
"
Manowar," 
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air,
the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar,
from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection,
success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!
"
Manowar," 
In the nights 
We take flights 
Witness the sites 
The power and glory of steel 
I fought and died 
Lived many lives before 
I am immortal like my sword 
I kneel to no one except the lord 
And my lord is steel 
If you see me you just passed your time 
To the hills you can run but not hide 
Blood and death are wherever i ride 
Armed for battle the lord on my side 
Stand and face the lord of steel 
The lord of steel 
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned 
Let your punishment begin 
Only by death you atone 
You shall not die alone 
For the glory of battle 
I will fight until i die 
Live one day as an eagle 
Or a lifetime as a fly 
Like a candle burning 
The wheels of time are turning 
The lord of steel commands you 
To die by my hand 
Stand and fight the lord of steel 
Time to face the lord of steel
"
Manowar," 
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin!
"
Manowar," 
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
"
Manowar," 
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die"
Manowar," 
We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

"
Manowar," 
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
"
Manowar," 
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
"
Manowar," 
If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast
Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder
"
Manowar," 
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
"
Manowar," 
Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who I am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die
"
Manowar," 
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
"
Manowar," 
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
"
Manowar," 
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Manowar," 
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have, one day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Here I'll pass the night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore
Loneliness will fade away
Time will stop until the day
You return into my arms
To hold me like before
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have
One day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe, now and forever
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of...Again, I see you standing there watching me
You gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself, there's fascination in the air

I try to fight this strong...There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit...Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And...Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come the army of the night
Mater Maria
Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final..."
Manowar," 
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my soul.
He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in blood to pay.
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way.
And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up to hells hot wind.
Face one more evil than thou, take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Manowar," 
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall

We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
"
Manowar," 
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know
On hell's wind, I shall appear, your death will not be slow
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
My vengeance is righteous, my souls fed by hate
My brothers of metal, will you ride with us today?
We ride for death, for glory, for blood and revenge
Lord of steel let the battle begin, and let it never end
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
Death is on my side
Time to seal your fate
Meet the sword of hate
By blood and steel you will die
Death is on my side

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song"
Manowar," 
When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching ""Billy Graham"" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away

I've nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late

Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They pray I will never appear

They live in a castle of fear
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
All the days of his life
He walked without fear
All whose lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So too his justice and retribution were unfailing
As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
The light within
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom Come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

Dreadful Thunder
The storms moving in
And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory 
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die"
Manowar," 
Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived"
Manowar," 
Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...
I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...

He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let ye not pass
Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a god-damn
bad machine, young'n'hungry, not too proud'n'mean
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,

Got the world right by the balls. This world ain't
big enough to keep me down. Yea we're livin'

Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.
Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat.
Well they all want to know what people say is true,
You know, get a biker started 'n he'll drive all
damn night. Well hold on honey 'cause this ride's for a ride.

I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.

With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.

I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock
"
Manowar,"
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends

Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Darkness all around us

No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Comin' at us no stopping
Always Carry On
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together

Manowar," 
He is descended from giants. His father Loki
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels

Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam

Pull along side

So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
Now, you were sittin' home

""Powers of the Universe did sire a Son
He was baptized by Fire Water Earth and Sky
From darkness he rose up in Triumph
To ascend the Throne of Light
And He Alone shall forever be known
As the King of Kings""
I entered this World born under a sign of Infinite Light
And here I shall dwell
I now understand all that I am
Shall live in Thy command!
"
Manowar," 
In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

Manowar," 
Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I ponder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smashed
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end...
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame!
Blood is our name..
Soul full of thunder!!
Hearts of steel
Killers of men!
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods
today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of Odin we four..!!
By the hammer of Thor!
Ride down from the sky....
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die!!!!
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail
Gods
of War!!!
...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!
"
Manowar," 
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

To carry the sword of our fathers
Who fell with their brothers
And ours there below
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land
We may die in thousands
They will understand
We will not surrender
Not one boy or man
Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands
He said
Carry the fight on for me
For all the sons of the highlands
Fight for the right to be free
Never be owned
They may raise our cities
They may burn the land

Come take the sword of the highlands
From my cold dead hands

To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.

So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh!

Kill, kill, Oh!

From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say ""I believe""
Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave

I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

Crossing the sky

Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand

To join thee by thy side
Let Valhalla's gates open wide
Born under the sign
Of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
"
Manowar," 
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!
"
Manowar," 
Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
"
Manowar," 
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
"
Manowar," 
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

Manowar," 
In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano
Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'
Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori
A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra
Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere
Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quello che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te
Padre, un' ultima cosa
Tu hai sempre saputo
Che quello che hai detto
Era vero

Warriors take the field
The battlefield of life
You cannot run
You cannot hide
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Only one of us will win
and return to fight again
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide
I've sworn an oath in blood to defend the land
and all who wish to test their steel well here I am
I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods
Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide

Manowar," 
Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
"
Manowar," 
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
"
Manowar," 
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,

"
Manowar," 
Near to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
A warrior's friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods, today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail, Gods of War!
Sons of Odin, we four
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die
(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) A warrior's friend
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

(oh) Hail, Gods of War!
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail
(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!
Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage!
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power!
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day!
Hail Gods Of War!
"
Manowar," 
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait now we are home
Now we will fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of Steel now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel

"
Manowar," 
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave

Manowar," 
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world"
Manowar," 
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine

Manowar," 
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air,
the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar,
from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection,
success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!
"
Manowar," 
In the nights 
We take flights 
Witness the sites 
The power and glory of steel 
I fought and died 
Lived many lives before 
I am immortal like my sword 
I kneel to no one except the lord 
And my lord is steel 
If you see me you just passed your time 
To the hills you can run but not hide 
Blood and death are wherever i ride 
Armed for battle the lord on my side 
Stand and face the lord of steel 
The lord of steel 
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned 
Let your punishment begin 
Only by death you atone 
You shall not die alone 
For the glory of battle 
I will fight until i die 
Live one day as an eagle 
Or a lifetime as a fly 
Like a candle burning 
The wheels of time are turning 
The lord of steel commands you 
To die by my hand 
Stand and fight the lord of steel 
Time to face the lord of steel
"
Manowar," 
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin!

Manowar," 
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

Manowar," 
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die"
Manowar," 
We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more

Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

"
Manowar," 
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
"
Manowar," 
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
"
Manowar," 
If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever born from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain that learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast
Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the thunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder
"
Manowar," 
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who I am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die

I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
"
Manowar," 
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
"
Manowar," 
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, ""Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear""
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have, one day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Here I'll pass the night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore
Loneliness will fade away
Time will stop until the day
You return into my arms
To hold me like before
All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have
One day will come true
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind
And in you I believe, now and forever
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Where eagles fly, I will wait for you
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do

You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time

I'm made of...Again, I see you standing there watching me
You gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself, there's fascination in the air

I try to fight this strong...There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack

Jump in the cockpit...Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And...Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come the army of the night
Mater Maria
Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final..."
Manowar," 
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my soul.
He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in blood to pay.
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way.
And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up to hells hot wind.
Face one more evil than thou, take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name, is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

Manowar," 
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind
"
Manowar," 
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Manowar," 
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
"
Manowar," 
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know
On hell's wind, I shall appear, your death will not be slow
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
My vengeance is righteous, my souls fed by hate
My brothers of metal, will you ride with us today?
We ride for death, for glory, for blood and revenge
Lord of steel let the battle begin, and let it never end
This blood vow I'll carry to the grave
Let all who fear me know
I was born of black wind, fire and steel
The gates of hell are my home
By blood and steel you will die
Death is on my side
Time to seal your fate
Meet the sword of hate
By blood and steel you will die

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song"

When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill

Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride

Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whisky I'll be on my way

Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching ""Billy Graham"" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
